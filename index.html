                <em>Dear Diary, 
                Today in math class....</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Diaries, Journals, Personal Records, or whatever people call them can be more than just a list of the day's events.
                They can be places of growth, sounding boards, and small crucibles that we can use to get through hard times, easy times, 
                or any times.  And they don't just have to contain writing.  

                There are so many books and articles out there that praise journaling, but I'm just going to share my experiences with you.
                So grab a cup of tea and pull up a chair. There will be no bibliography or quiz on the subject.  Just food for throught.

            <h3>A Few Benefits of Journaling</h3>
            <h4>A space to process events</h4>
            <p> 
                Ever have an amazing or intense day?  While it is nice to talk it over with others, journaling can allow for relfection that we 
                may or may not want to share out loud.  Writing it down in a space that is all yours can be liberating.  A journal holds no expectations, 
                no cultural or family standards, or rules of any kind.  It's a bound lump of paper that doesn't contain any manuals or directions.   No batteries.
                No obligations.  No shame.  A place to say things that others wouldn't expect.  
            
            <h4>A Time Capsule</h4>
            <p>
                Along with a space for reflection and processing, it can also be a time capsule.  Did you have a blast celebraing your BFF's birthday?  Write that down.
                Have a rough day at work?  Write it down.  The good, the bad, and the ugly.  Write it all down.  This can help us remember things.  Can help us 
                recall and relive the memories.

                Why would you want to recall bad or negative memories?  To see any patterns?  Do you only feel this way at work when coworker X is there?  During rush hour?
                Were you hangry?  Was it your reaction or their actions?  Sometimes recalling these not so pretty ones can help us see where we could change it next time, or even 
                verify that we might need to start looking for a new job or proof that someone really is toxic.

            <h3>There is No One Way to Journal</h3>
            <h4>Rule 1:  There are no rules</h4>
            <p>
                I know that probably made you roll your eyes.  But it's true.  If you write down things about your life, you're journaling.  If you just draw based on how your feel, 
                that is journaling.  If you write a poem or story about your life, that's journaling.  Write in pen, sure.  Pencil, sure.  Crayons, yup.  Blood, well yes, but you're getting a 
                little dramatic there...

            <p>
                There are certain "Types" of journals out there that are run on themes.  But even then, if you start your journal one way and change ut up on entry 3, no worries. I'll share two of 
                my favorites, but there are so many more options.
            </p>
            <h5>The Art Journal</h5>
            <p> 
                An Art Journal is just that.  A jounral that you do art in rather than write.  Any 2D art will work, but keep your paper type in mind.
                This can be a sketchbook you buy ready to go, or something you create from other materials, such as envelopes or a composition book.  
                I like to use ink and watercolor, so my art journal is more a pile of watercolor paper cut into various sizes based on the project and lives in a box.
                But I still try to engage in it weekly and paint in a meditative manner rather than for a specfic outcome.  
                <!-- examples: -->
            </p>
            <h5>The Bullet Journal</h5>
            <p> 
                A personal favorite.  A Bullet Journal is a combination journal meets planner meets art journal.  The premise is that you make a collection of dashboards where you 
                keep signficant pieces of data.  Usually, one dashboard is dedicated to the month for planning and tracking events.  One can be dedicated to tracking books/movies/places you want to 
                read/see/visit.  Another common dashboard is a weekly view, where you can focus on a single week at a time.  Between all the dashboards is where you journal.

                These can be very nice, but time consuming depending on the amount of detail or number of dashboards you want to use.  Personally, I have a monthly dashboard with my goals, current reading list, significant dates.  
                I also use weekly dashboards to track my goals on a daily basis.  Mine are very simple, but they help me stay focued on my goals between days, weeks, and months.  I keep it simple so I don't have to repeat
                a lot of items when I need a new journal.  And for really significant or repeated things (eg: birthdays), I use my phone.

            <h3>Inspiration for Journals</h3>
            <h4>The Journal itself</h4>
            <p>
                Best advice:  Pick something you will actually use.  I've been journaling since elementary school.  I have been gifted many beautiful journals.  I hardly ever use them.
                It's not that they aren't good, but for me they are too pretty or fancy.  I save them for art journals now.  

                My favorite journal is a trusty composition book.  You can completely transform them into something that looks more fancy, or keep as is.  They are inexpensive, 
                not too fancy, and really easy to change as you feel.  I stock up during back-to-school sales.  This is my jam.  Go find yours.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Fun Pens</h4>
            <p>
                Write with something you enjoy.  I prefer ink, highlighters, and markers.  While I do enjoy gel pens, I write too fast and smear them most of the time.
                Have fun with color, highlight things, doodle in the margins.  Use a pen you like.  I recommend uniball pens.  They flow smoothly and make writing or dooddling \
                easy.
            </p>
            <h4>Items of Inspiration</h4>
            <h5>Prompts</h5>
            <p>
                Sometimes it can be hard to write.  Use the internet or social media to search for prompts.  There are many many many prompts out there.  Prompts for writing and art.  
                Have at it.
            </p>
            
            
            <h5>Oracle Cards</h5>
            <p>
                I love Oracle cards.  I don't use them to tell fortunes, but rather for looking for the lesson of the day.  You can pull an oracle card in the morning and look for the
                lesson as you go through your day.  You can pull one at night and think about the lesson as you reflect on your day.  

                These can be really good if you don't feel like writing.
            </p>
            <h5>Daily Artifacts</h5>
            <p>
                This is a big category for the things you collect during your day.  You can make a pocket in your journal to hold these, or just tape/glue them directly on the page.  Some 
                examples include: ticket stubs, recipts, business cards, stickers, feathers, flowers, pictures, etc.  You can keep them as they are or modify them (color them, doodle on them, add stickers, etc)
            </p>
            
            <h5>Stickers, tape, etc</h5>
            <p>
               Sometimes it's just fun to add beauty to your journal.  Washi Tape, stickers, Daily Artifacts, doodles, quotes, etc.
               You can open up a random page and just doodle what you ate for breakfast, or tape in a ticket stub.
            </p>
                Add a pocket using tape.  It's super easy, and holds artifacts well.
