This was a LaunchCode project to demonstrate skills with HTML5 and CSS.

We were first instructed to create the structure by writing the HTML first.  Once the "walls" were in place, we decorated them with CSS.


HTML requirements:
 + at least 1 of the following tags:
      = <p> 
      = <header>
      = <footer> 
      = <main>
      = <article>
 + at least 1 image with correct tags
 + at least 1 HTML entity


CSS requirements:
 + margins and padding
 + at least 1 of each of the following selectors:  
    = element
    = class
    = id
